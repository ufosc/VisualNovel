    mc "That was mean of me."
    js "Oh, it’s okay."
    js "It was really just a misunderstanding."
    mc "Okay, whew. I was scared you would still be mad at me."
    js "No, it’s okay."
    js "I’m not mad."
    js "Thank you for coming and sitting with me."
    js "I am really excited to eat this lunch."

    mc "Yeah me too, I love plantains."
    mc "And I didn’t get to eat breakfast."
    js "Why not? Breakfast is like the most important meal of the day."
    mc "My morning was a mess."
    mc "I am from an area about 4 hours away from here and so I had to stay in a hotel."
    mc "And last night I was up way too late."
    mc "And as you can guess I didn’t wake up on time."
    js "Did you make it to orientation on time?"
    mc "Well that was the worst part."
    mc "I rushed out the door and got in my car in like 3 minutes."
    mc "But when I started driving I realized I didn’t even know where the school was."
    js "Yeah I ran into the same problem."
    js "I have never been to this town before."
    mc "Then I eventually got here and I realized I missed all of orientation."
    mc "Luckily there was a professor there who told me where I was supposed to go."
    mc "And that’s how I ended up in the breakout room."
    js "You met a professor?"
    js "I don’t think there are any professors on campus right now."
    js "Classes haven’t started so they have no reason to be here."
    mc "Huh I didn’t think of that."
    mc "She was definitely older than us and seemed really knowledgeable."
    mc "She definitely wasn’t a student, she looked too old to be anywhere near our age."
    mc "Actually, she kinda reminded me of you…"
    js "Hmm, yeah well actually-"
